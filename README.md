Business cards are quite a pain to carry around.

You never quite know how many to bring along to a meeting or a work-related event. And there’s that awkward moment mid-handshake when you’ve realized that you’re out of business cards.

Despite all the fuss, business cards still remain a great tool for exchanging contact information. But can we do this without needing physical business cards?

Scan and save
What if all it took to exchange contact information was a simple scan and save?

Imagine this: you are trying to obtain contact information from person A. Person A displays a QR code on their phone, and all you have to do is scan their phone using your iPhone camera. Their contact information is automatically displayed on your phone and you hit the save button. Voila, now you have their contact information in your Contacts list.

If you’re currently on your desktop/laptop, you might want to grab your phone to give this a go.

Contact information displayed on mobile website and VCF in the Contacts app after download
All the fields in the mobile website are interactive. If you tapped on the contact number field, you would automatically dial the number.

After clicking on the download button, a Virtual Contact File (VCF) will be downloaded and synced into your Contacts app instantly.

Simple enough, isn’t it?
